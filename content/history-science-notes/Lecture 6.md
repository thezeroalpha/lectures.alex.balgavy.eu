## Rise of Internet
"confluence of 3 desires”

government and France Telecom offered the Minitel computer. one of the largest consumer networks, larger than most American stuff

netherlands — Viditel (1980), Dutch version of Minitel. was not as popular because the gov didn’t fund it as much

electronic mail (1981) was one of the biggest uses in America, not as much in Europe. still, companies/unis/gov used it.

in the US, it’s big networks owned by companies. in EU, every country had its own network, owned by governments.

Rise of gaming:

- playing was used during the years as a way of appropriating
- Chess by Alan Turing, Nimbus, Spacewar!, Pong
- Pacman was the turning point, started selling computers and making more money
- that’s when people realised this could be a business

## Rise of computer science & information science as academic discipline
In the US, they started as a group.
in France, mainly from social sciences or engineering schools

First NL Bachelor program was in 1981, you have a masters since graduation in 1973

Bachelor in Information Science was first at Tilburg Catholic School (home of SSAA) — sign of professionalisation

Eventually, the three traditions split into various courses (approximately):

- Administration => IMM
- Process Control => LI
- Science => CS

### Paradigm shifts:

- content-oriented —> service-oriented
- local —> “global”
- pc as tool —> pc as gateway to internet

info society => knowledge society

### Esther Dyson

- studied econ at Harvard, wealthy parents
- both parents studied exact sciences
- did good investments
- CEOs valued her observations in her newsletter “Release” and Release 2.1 about digital culture

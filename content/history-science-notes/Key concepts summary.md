- Babbage, Fayol & Taylor
- Trust
- Three traditions — administration, process control, science

Cold War feel:

- US — gains from WW2 Manhattan project, ENIAC, NASA, Atomic power
- EU — fatalism & optimism, rebuilding, Mathematisch Centrum (research center), Freudenthal “Rekenmachines"

Dinosaurs:

- US — Manchester Baby, EDSAC
- EU — scientific, ARRA series and X1, PETER (overall Amsterdam, Delft, Eindhoven)

Golden Age of Sci-Fi:

- advertising computers to people
- themes of totalitarianism, nationalism, surveillance, censorship
- literature — Asimov, Huxley, Orwell, Heinlein, Clarke, Dick
- films — Metropolis, Desk Set, Forbidden Planet

Computing sounds:

- relays leading to sounds for debugging
- Strachey & EDSAC - God Save The Queen
- creating music with computers

Language changes, metaphor:

- language — “programming”, “plugging”, “memory"

IBM “Big Blue” vs everyone:

- Seven Dwarves in US: Burroughs, Honeywell, Control Data Corporation, General Electric
- European Dwarves: Zuse (GER), Electrologica (NL), Regnecentralen (Denmark)
- sales tactic of FUD, IBM had more resources

Real time computing:

- Whirlwind/SAGE — flight simulator by Jay Forrester, then IBM and Burroughs, eventually used for regulating plane traffic
- cashless society ideal — Barclays cash dispenser, credit cards, ‘universal’ product code (US vs Europe)
- decimal day — Barclays & Burroughs (not IBM cuz not British), build B8500 connecting to TC500, sold before built, lots of problems and eventually IBM

Programming:

- ALGOL60 vs FORTRAN vs COBOL
- programming becoming a job
- software becoming economic commodity
- 1968 IBM Unbundling, result of software crisis (or was there one?)

Silicon Valley:

- time sharing facilities, democratic movement, developments in hardware (wristwatches)
- Whole Earth Catalog, 2001
- Ted Nelson’s Computer Lib (“understand computers now”)
- people started wanting computers
- Homebrew Computer Club

EU valleys:

- no interest from youth Hippies, too forced
- Twente polytechnic (Enschede) tried
- utopian city planning
- Hobby Computer Club

Appropriation:

- VisiCalc, Teleac, SSAA
- Squatter movement, Chaos Computer Club (activism, political statement)
- computers in education — educating large amount, making them think, flowcharts, Ecole/BASIC, programmed instruction
- EU demoscenes — magazines, underground journalism, stories, pictures
- personal computers, support from governments in EU, de digitale stad

Rise of internet:

- confluence of 3 desires — good networking technology, unifying all computers on network, making knowledge available
- US company networks (AOL, CompuServe), EU government networks (minitel, viditel), email
- gaming — pacman turned it into a business

Rise of academic disciplines:

- Administration => IMM, Process Control => LI, Science => CS
- EU vs US

Paradigm shifts:

- content to service-oriented
- local to ‘global'
- pc as a tool => pc as gateway to internet (knowledge)
- therefore, info to knowledge society

Digital culture

- Esther Dyson & “Release”, her observations on digital culture
- online library catalogues, desktop publishing, art, online meetings
- motion graphics in movies, changing everything
- eventually developed into risk society, big data, privacy (Project X), controlling what goes wrong
- Saskia Stuiveling — focused on openness, president o fDutch Court of audit

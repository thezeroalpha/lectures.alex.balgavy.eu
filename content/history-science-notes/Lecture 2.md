# Lecture 2

After WW2, people started putting faith in machines that didn’t work, and they made them work.

The need for scientific calculations exploded.

## Cold war science
In the US:

- During WW2, Manhattan project was successful in new nuclear/medical applications that could develop further after the war
- worldwide computer power dick measuring contest — who has the bigger, more powerful computer?
    - Vannevar Bush was aware and started with the ENIAC during the war, but it wasn’t done till like 1945
- hand-in-hand with space race — NASA
- another measuring contest — Atomic power

Continental EU:

- mood was a mix of fatalism and optimism, scientists felt like science could offer a lot
    - in late 1940s — rebuilding the nation and economy (Marshall plan)
    - Mathematisch Centrum (1946) would help to rebuild the Netherlands
- people started realising that computers really *are *important
    - Hans Freudenthal — "Rekenmachines winnen den oorlog”
    - JJSS — “Le Defi Americain” (The American Challenge)
    - needed for stuff like aeronautical calculations, code breaking (Bletchley Park), radar

Dinosaurs (some of the first computers)

- US
    - “Manchester Baby” in Manchester, 1948
    - “EDSAC” in Cambridge, 1949, Maurice Wilkes
- EU
    - in the EU, none of the computer innovations originated in the administrative tradition, it was all scientific
    - Amsterdam
        - mostly Mathematisch Centrum: Aad van Wijngaarden, Jan van der Corput
        - ARRA (1952), ARRA II (1954), ARMAC (1956), Electrologica X1
    - Delft
        - Willem van der Poel — built ARCO/Testudo
        - others were ZERO, PTERA, ZEBRA, STANTEC
    - Eindhoven
        - Wim Nijenhuis built PETER for acoustic measurement, to improve music industry
        - following were NATLAB, PASCAL, STEVIN
- all of these used components like relays, vacuum tubes, etc. they were often unreliable, and had poorly soldered connections.

For the public — this was the Golden Age of Science Fiction!

- most people never actually saw a computer, yet were still putting money in
- the ideas had to be sold to the public, otherwise they’d protest
- Dystopian literature in Europe
- themes were totalitarianism, nationalism, surveillance, censorship
- Examples:
    - Literature:
        - Isaac Asimov — "I, Robot”, “Foundation”
        - Aldous Huxley — "Brave New World"
        - George Orwell — “1984" (this was huuuge and still is)
        - Robert Heinlein — "Starship Troopers", "Stranger in a Strange Land"
        - Arthur C. Clarke — “Interplanetary Flight”, “Childhood’s End”, “Rama”, “2001" (fantastic book and film, directed by Stanley Kubrick)
        - Philip K. Dick — “What makes us human?”
    - Films:
        - Metropolis
        - Desk Set (1957)
        - Forbidden Planet (1956)

# Prehistory of computing

Ideals made machines into a success

- in the 18th century, machines were for entertainment
    - autonomous piano player
    - mechanical turk
- Charles Babbage (1791-1871)
    - "On the economy of machines and manufacturers”
    - son of a rich banker dude from London, mathematician
    - good ideas, started working on Difference Engine & thought of Analytical Engine
    - never actually produced a machine, so the government basically told him to piss off and stopped giving him money
- Frederik Taylor (1856-1915)
    - "Shop management", "The principles of scientific management"
    - tried to systematically describe what systems do and how, using flowcharts to solve problems
- Henri Fayol (1841-1925)
    - “Administration industrielle et generale"

- Trust in numbers & machines
    - initially, trust in machines was not obvious
    - they were built to fool or destroy you
    - trust grew during the 19th century
    - US census in 1890 — government counted people, and Hollerith machines were used to count and produce a table
- Three traditions
    - Administration — **money**, (felt) urgency, outlines, practices
        - table making, printing, punched card typing, calculators, typewriters
        - Sorting, counting, and tabulating machines
        - The office in 1876 vs Office in 1920
        - Efficiency movement
    - Process control — outlines, technology (analog), practices
        - processes in mining & oil companies
        - Shell with their huge factories, Hoogovens
        - Edison or DSM
    - Science and engineering — concepts, calculations, outlines
        - human computers active in weather prediction calc, mechanical calc, aeronautics, econometry, telephones, military applications
        - Douglas Hartree: "Numerical analysis"
        - Differential analyser — making calculations easier
    - all three were concerned with outlines — plans for how the current systems and processes could be improved
- this set the pre-war scene for development during the war — e.g. Colossus in Poland
- people wanted to build cross-tradition machines, but why? it would be too expensive…so they didn't

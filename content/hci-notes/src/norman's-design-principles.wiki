== Norman's design principles ==
1. Visibility
    * if more stuff is visible, the user's more likely to know what to do next
    * when functions are hidden, it makes them more difficult to find and know how to use
    * sometimes things are designed so we can't see how to make them work
    * need to see the state of a device and possible actions
    * so hide functions that are not immediately needed
2. Feedback
    * send back info about what actions have been done, what's been accomplished
    * audio, tactile, verbal, etc.
3. Constraints
    * restrict possible user actions
4. Mapping
    * relationship between controls and their effects
    * e.g. up/down arrows to represent up/down movement of cursor
5. Consistency
    * similar concepts expressed in similar ways. use conventions.
    * follows rules - aesthetic, functional, layout
6. Affordance
    * perceived/actual properties of an object that helps to figure out how it works
    * e.g. mouse button invites pushing
    * 'afford': 'give a clue'

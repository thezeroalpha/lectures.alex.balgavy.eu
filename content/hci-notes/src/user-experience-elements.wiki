== User experience (UX) elements ==
* form: graphic design, product design
* content: information architecture, audio-visual, text
* behaviour: interaction design observation

UX deliverables:
* analysis & research: personas, qualitative user research/reports, user stories, competitive analysis, scorecards
* design: functional specs, flow diagrams, UI specs
* prototypes: clickable prototypes, mockups
* visual design: polished design & layout, icons & graphic things
* technical communications: web content, help, guides, videos, localization

Terms of interaction:
* domain: area of work under study (like graphic design)
* goal: what you want to achieve
* task: how you go about doing it, in terms of operations/actions

gulf of execution: user's formulation of actions ≠ actions allowed by the system
gulf of evaluation: user's expectation of changed system state ≠ actual presentation of that state

human errors:
* slip: incorrect action (need better interface design)
* mistake: may not have the right goal (need better understanding of system)

goals:
* efficiency/productivity? effective learning?
* usability goals: meeting specific usability criteria
    * effectiveness
    * efficiency (minimal steps, simple)
    * safety (does the system prevent users from fuckin up?)
    * learnability: people are impatient, manuals are tedious, nobody wants to fuckin do it. they should be able to learn the system in under 10 minutes.
    * utility: the extent to which system provides functionality that user needs
    * memorability: meaningful icons, command names, menus, so that the user can remember shit without always having to go back to the manual
* user experience goalz: develop the quality of the user experience (a e s t h e t i c, games)
    * design isn't just about efficiency and productivity
    * the point is, do you feel nice and warm inside while using the system?

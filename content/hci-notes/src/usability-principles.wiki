== Usability principles ==
Nielsen usability principles:
1. Visibility of system status
    * always keep user informed about what's happening
    * like a progress bar
2. Match between system and real world
    * speak the users' language
    * use words, phrases, concepts familiar to user
3. User control and freedom
    * allow users to easily escape from places where they accidentally appeared
    * like 'emergency exits'
4. Consistency and standards
    * don't make the user think
    * avoid making them wonder whether different shit is actually the same shit
5. Help users recognise, diagnose, and recover from errors
    * write errors in plain language
    * suggest a way of solving it.
6. Error prevention
    * prevent errors whenever possible
7. Recognition is better than recall
    * make stuff recognisable
8. Flexibility and efficiency of use
    * provide accelerators invisible to novices
    * give more experienced users more tools
9. Aesthetic & minimalist design
    * don't include irrelevant or rarely needed information
    * *hide the stuff*
10. Help and documentation
    * provide info that can be easily searched
    * give concrete steps that can be easily followed

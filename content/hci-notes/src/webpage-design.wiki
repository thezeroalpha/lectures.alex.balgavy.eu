%template math
== Webpage design ==
people rarely read websites, and they teleport from search engines to any page.
so any page should be a plausible starting point.
people have a goal on the page, they don't give a fuck about how beautiful it is (unless it's so ugly that it's unusable).
also, they hate scrolling when they're looking for something. users are lazy.

people ignore banners, image carousels, anything that resembles advertising.

guidelines:
* don't break conventions
* create visual hierarchies and structure
* make obvious what's clickable
* always make a short summary, people are lazy

navigation:
* make it clear where people are & where they can go
* information must be available everywhere

Menus:
* desktop
    * put them across the top or on the left
    * don't use hidden navigation
* mobile
    * if only few items, put them at the top
    * always show _most important_ items
    * provide support to help people find the hamburger

alignment:
* text: depending on language, most of the time left
* names: make scanning for surnames easy
* numbers: align decimal points, or right-align integers. depends on purpose.

use whitespace smartly, to delineate/separate/structure, but also to highlight.

# Advanced Logic
1. [Lecture 1](lecture-1)
2. [Lecture 2](lecture-2)
3. [Exercise 1](exercise-1)

I drew the graphs on these pages with [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/).
You can install Graphviz and run e.g. `dot < graph.dot -Tsvg > graph.svg` (also accepts input files as parameters).
Or you can install [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/), surround the code with `@startdot...@enddot`, and run `plantuml -p -Tsvg < graph.puml > graph.svg`.

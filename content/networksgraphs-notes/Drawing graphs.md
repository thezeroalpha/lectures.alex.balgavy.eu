# Drawing graphs
Embeddings:

- circular embedding — vertices are spaced evenly around a circle
- ranked embedding — choose an arbitrary vertex u, rank other vertices by distance from u, put vertices on separate lines based on ranking

Planar graphs: graphs where no edges cross

- interior region: empty space enclosed by a cycle
- exterior region: empty space not enclosed by a cycle
- Euler’s formula for planar graphs:
    - n-m+r=2
    - n vertices, m edges, r regions
- condition for planar graph: m ≤ 3v-6
- every planar graph has a vertex *v, *with δ(*v*) ≤ 5

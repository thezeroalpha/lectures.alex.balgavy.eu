# Glossary
- // — denotes a comment
- << — “put into” operator
- C++ — the language C, but improved

- comment — documentation, only seen by the programmer and not read by the compiler

- compiler — turns source code into object code
- compile-time error — an error caught while compiling
- cout — character output stream
- executable — a program that can run on a computer

- function — a subprocess that has multiple parts to it (return type, name, parameters, code)

- header — an external file with code

- IDE — development environment that has everything, and can both compile and execute code

- #include — make available code from other libraries (preprocessor directive)
- library — an external file with functions
- linker — ‘links’ together code compiled separately into one executable file
- main() — every C++ program needs this, the first method that is executed
- object code — compiled source code
- output — result from a program
- program — a thing you can run on your computer
- source code — text written by programmer
- statement — a single line of code
- assignment — giving a value to a variable
- cin — character input stream
- concatenation — combining two strings
- conversion — changing from one type to another
- declaration — naming something (variable, function, etc.) in a statement
- decrement — decrease value
- definition — declaration that sets aside memory for an object
- increment — increase value
- initialization — give a variable an initial value
- name — (obvious)

- narrowing — putting a value into an object that is too small for the value (e.g. large int into a char)

- object — region of memory with a type
- operation — something that you do to a value
- operator — +, -, /, *, ==, <=, ……...
- type — int, float, bool, double..

- type safety — safely converting from one type to another (initializing a variable before using it, converting correctly)

- value — set of bits in memory, interpreted according to type
- variable — a named object

# Header files
- collections of declarations
- conventionally have extension .h
- #included near “head” of program

## `#include`
- copies contents of header into program text
- for consistency, #include interface of class into file with its implementation
- handled by preprocessor (first compiler phase) — check what it does by g++ -E

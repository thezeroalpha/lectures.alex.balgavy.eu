# Server-side
- not all requests are for static content, need dynamic content through programmable server behaviour
    - from a browser's perspective, it's just a URI
    - how to deal with this?
- enter CGI: common gateway interface
    - commonly agreed way to run scripts as response to HTTP requests
    - program's output returned verbatim to client
    - pros: very flexible
    - cons: new process per request, inconvenient with DBs, mixes program logic & HTML
- alternatives: frameworks, other languages
    - PHP, Java, Python, Ruby on Rails
    - templates: stuff like Bottle, Flask, Handlebars…
- problems: concurrency, sessions/cookies, security…
    - concurrency solution
        - multiple threads (multithreading)
        - master thread delegates requests
    - sessions
        - how do you identify users? cookies.
        - first connection, user given ID in cookie
        - subsequent requests contain info (ID), used by the server for e.g. shopping cart
    - database connectivity
        - all frameworks simplify DB interaction
        - a server needs a LAMP (or MAMP, or WinAMP)
            - OS with TCP/IP support (Linux)
            - HTTP server implementation (Apache)
            - Database for content (MySQL)
            - Framework to make page from database (PHP)
    - security issues
        - some clients don't have access to servers: proxy
        - some servers can't access clients: reverse proxy
        - auth & encryption
            - originally HTTP 1.0 Basic Access Auth (plaintext)
            - now, HTTPS over secure layer (public key encryption, everything is encrypted)
                - not as vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks
                - site needs to send certificate, which is signed by a CA (certificate authority)
        - cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
            - opt in using HTTP headers
            - include origin, then server verifies if it's OK

# Evaluation of Websites
## Why evaluate?

- attract more visitors
- sell more products
- decide which web app to use
- improve visitor ratings
- etc.

## Evaluation studies

- always start with a clear research question
    - aka "problem statement"
    - practical/theoretical relevance, feasible
    - types of studies
        - explorative — what is related?
            - e.g. why do people visit the site again?
        - descriptive — what happens?
            - e.g. how many people find the site through a SE?
        - explanatory — why does it happen?
            - if you add login, do people visit the site again?
            - does a change in structure make it easier for visitors to find what they're looking for?
- make a hypothesis
    - a prediction of outcome of test
    - deduced from theory or observations
- collect data
    - e.g. in lab experiments, survey, interview…
    - qualitative (non-numerical) and quantitative (numerical)
    - test dependent var with respect to independent var
    - specific population (customers/all web users/registered users/whatever)
    - specific sample (random/convenience/volunteers)
- evaluation methods
    - common
        - mockups
            - low fidelity — early in design phase, only basic functionality, static, cheap. focus on concepts.
            - high fidelity — later in design phase, refined details, expensive.
        - prototypes — working example of website
        - focus groups — moderated group discussion, early in design stage.
        - card sorting — group of people sort items into clusters to get intuitive structure for website
        - usability inspection — go systematically through website, check against Ten Web Guidelines. performed by dev team.
        - group walkthrough — group of people walk through website as if performing primary tasks
        - user testing — remote, observe user while primary tasks are performed. log actions, eye tracking, record video/audio.
        - survey

    - specific to web evaluation
        - web analytics
            - analyse logfiles
            - JavaScript page tagging to capture visitor data
            - very good objective data, but privacy concerns and no insight into motivation or unvisited pages.
        - online experiments
            - distribute visitors over versions, see which performs better
            - after release
            - example: A/B testing

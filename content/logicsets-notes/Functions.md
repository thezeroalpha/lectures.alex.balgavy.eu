# Functions
Function f: A ➝ B — binary relation f of type A × B such that every x ∈ A relates to at most one y ∈ B

- domain: all possible input values
- domain of definition: all input values that actually produce defined output
- codomain: what could be the output of a function (like “integers” with f(x)=2x)
- range/image: what actually is the output of a function (like “even numbers” with f(x)=2x)

injective: if each element x of domain maps to at most one element y of codomain (“one-to-one”)

surjective: if each element x of domain maps to at least one element y of codomain; the range is the codomain (“onto”)

total: if the function is defined for all possible input values (domain)

bijective: if the function is total, injective, and surjective


## Composition:
(g o f) of f: A ➝ B and g: B ➝ C

- $D_{g \circ f} \subseteq D_f$
- $R_{g \circ f} \subseteq R_g$

## Inverse:
a function has an inverse only if it’s injective (one-to-one)

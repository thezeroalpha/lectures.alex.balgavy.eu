# Equivalence relations & classes
## Equivalence relation in V
relation R of type V × V that satisfies:

- reflexivity: x R x
- transitivity: x R y ∧ y R z ➝ x R z
- symmetry: x R y ➝ y R x

## Equivalence classes

an equivalence relation ≡ in a set V partitions the set into equivalence classes

equivalence class of p:
[p] = { x ∈ V: p ≡ x },    p ∈ V

all elements of equivalence class relate to each other

elements of different equivalence classes are unrelated

equivalence classes lead to a partition:
{ [p] : p ∈ V }

## Complete system of representatives

for ≡ in V is a set S ⊆ V that contains *exactly one *element from each equivalence class

in other words:
1. every v ∈ V is equivalent to some s ∈ S
2. two different elements of S are not equivalent

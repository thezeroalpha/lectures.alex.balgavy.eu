# Cardinality (notion of size)
|A| cardinality of A (size)

- |A| ≤ |B| ⟷ there exists a total injection f: A ➝ B
- |A| = |B| ⟷ there exists a bijection f: A ➝ B
- |A| = #A = m ⟷ there exists a bijection f: {1,…,m} ➝ A

## Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein theorem (partial ordering of sets)
if there exist total injective functions f: A ➝ B, g: B ➝ A

then there exists a bijection h: A ➝ B

so sets can be partially ordered by cardinality.

## Countable/Uncountable
set A is:

- countably infinite — there exists a bijection f: Nat ➝ A
- countable — A is finite or countably infinite
- uncountable — A is not countable

if a set is countable, it can be enumerated

# Famous lambda calculus terms
You probably need to memorize these.
- I = 𝜆x.x
- K = 𝜆x.𝜆y.x
- S = 𝜆x.𝜆y.𝜆z.xz(yz)
- Ω = (𝜆x.xx)(𝜆x.xx) — not strongly normalising

All are closed (no free variables). All are abstractions.

S, K, and I are terms in the SKI combinator calculus (combinatory logic, 'CL'). CL is undecidable, because you can't derive E ⊢ s = t.

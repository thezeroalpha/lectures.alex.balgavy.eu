= State Space Representations Intro =
  * real world is complex, state space must be _abstracted_ for problem solving
      * abstract states map to sets of real states
      * abstract action maps to combination of real actions
      * abstract solution = set of real paths that are solutions in real world
  * there may be multiple different state space representations

Problem-solving agent uses this representation:
  1. what are actions to move between states?
  2. what are appropriate states & initial states?
  3. what is the cost of an action?
  4. goal: what are the successful world states?
  5. search: determine possible sequences of actions leading to goal, choose 'best' sequence
  6. execute: give solution, perform actions

State space representation (example - vacuum cleaner):
  * start with real-life problem
  * formulate abstract problem (states, actions)
  * formulate concrete (clean house) & algorithmic goal (be in state 7 and 8)
  * find solution (sequence of actions to get to state 7 or 8)
  * execute plan (clean house according to abstract solution)

check learning goals on canvas.

everything in working groups (this means go through the sheets again)
  * informed search (DF, BF, DFID)
  * uninformed search (Hill Climbing, BF, A, A*)
  * adversarial search (minimax with alpha-beta)
  * logical representations
  * DPLL
  * uncertainty representations
  * Bayesian learning
  * NN/Deep learning

research procedure
  * take at least 4 bots you implemented
  * compare performance -- play against each other, in different environments
  * study results: outperforming, speed
  * define interesting hypotheses and research questions, use analysis to verify/falsify them

scientific paper structure:
  * title page with abstract
    * title and authors
    * abstract of 2-3 paragraphs
  * introduction: intro to problem, solution, some results (2 pages)
  * background info
    * describe game, challenge, IS framework, whatever else is needed (1-2 pages)
  * research question
    * describe approach
    * what are:
      * possible outcomes of setup and contribution
      * e.g. whether one method works, whether it works better than others
    * also, define "working better"
  * experimental setup (2 pages)
    * explain how experiments were set up
    * what you did in terms of implementation
    * compare different methods
    * define metrics
  * results (2 pages)
    * describe results in overview tables
    * point reader to most significant, interesting results
  * findings
  * conclusions

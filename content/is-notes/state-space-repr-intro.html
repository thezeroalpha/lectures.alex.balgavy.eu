<div id="State Space Representations Intro"><h1 id="State Space Representations Intro">State Space Representations Intro</h1></div>
<ul>
<li>
real world is complex, state space must be <em>abstracted</em> for problem solving

<ul>
<li>
abstract states map to sets of real states

<li>
abstract action maps to combination of real actions

<li>
abstract solution = set of real paths that are solutions in real world

</ul>
<li>
there may be multiple different state space representations

</ul>

<p>
Problem-solving agent uses this representation:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
what are actions to move between states?

<li>
what are appropriate states &amp; initial states?

<li>
what is the cost of an action?

<li>
goal: what are the successful world states?

<li>
search: determine possible sequences of actions leading to goal, choose 'best' sequence

<li>
execute: give solution, perform actions

</ol>

<p>
State space representation (example - vacuum cleaner):
</p>
<ul>
<li>
start with real-life problem

<li>
formulate abstract problem (states, actions)

<li>
formulate concrete (clean house) &amp; algorithmic goal (be in state 7 and 8)

<li>
find solution (sequence of actions to get to state 7 or 8)

<li>
execute plan (clean house according to abstract solution)

</ul>

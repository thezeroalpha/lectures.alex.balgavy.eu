<div id="Probability and Uncertainty"><h1 id="Probability and Uncertainty">Probability and Uncertainty</h1></div>
<p>
one often has to deal with info that is underspecified, incomplete, vague, etc.
</p>

<p>
logic by itself is not sufficient for these problems.
</p>

<div id="Probability and Uncertainty-Vagueness: Fuzzy Set Theory"><h2 id="Vagueness: Fuzzy Set Theory">Vagueness: Fuzzy Set Theory</h2></div>
<p>
model theory often based on set theory
</p>

<p>
fuzzy set theory allows something to be <em>to some degree</em> an element of a set
</p>

<p>
dominant approach to vagueness (mostly because wtf else can you do)
</p>

<div id="Probability and Uncertainty-Vagueness: Fuzzy Set Theory-Fuzzy sets"><h3 id="Fuzzy sets">Fuzzy sets</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
universe U, object x ∈ U

<li>
membership function for fuzzy set A is defined to be function \(f_A\) from U to [0,1]:

<ul>
<li>
\(f_A(x)=y\): x is a member of A to degree y

<li>
\(f_A(x)=1\): x is certainly member of A

<li>
\(f_A(x)=0\): x is certainly not a member of A

<li>
\({x | f_A(x)&gt;0}\): support of A

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
modifiers (hedges)
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
operations on fuzzy sets:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
complement: \(f_{\sim{A}}(x)=1-f_A(x)\)

<li>
union: \(f_{A\cup B}(x)=\max(f_A(x),f_B(x))\)

<li>
intersection: \(f_{A\cap B}(x)=\min(f_A(x), f_B(x))\)

<li>
subset: \(A\subset B \iff \forall{x}(f_A(x)\leq f_B(x))\)

</ul>

<p>
semantics -- multivalued fuzzy logic
</p>
<ul>
<li>
v(¬ A) = 1-v(A)

<li>
v(A ∨ B) = max(v(A), v(B))

<li>
v(A ∧ B) = min(v(A), v(B))

<li>
v(A → B) = min(1, 1 - v(A) + v(B))

</ul>

<div id="Probability and Uncertainty-Vagueness: Fuzzy Set Theory-Fuzzy relations"><h3 id="Fuzzy relations">Fuzzy relations</h3></div>
<p>
fuzzy sets can denote fuzzy relations between objects. e.g. approximately equal, close to, much larger than, etc.
</p>

<p>
fuzzy composition:
</p>

<p>
\(f_{R \circ S} (\langle x,z\rangle ) = \max_{y \in Y} \min(f_R (\langle x,y\rangle ), f_S (\langle y,z\rangle ))\)
</p>

<p>
hands-on example:

<div id="Probability and Uncertainty-Vagueness: Fuzzy Set Theory-Evaluation"><h3 id="Evaluation">Evaluation</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
good -- flexible, coincides with classical set theory, sever successful applications of fuzzy control

<li>
bad -- requires many arbitrary choices, tends to blur differences between probabilistic uncertainty/ambiguity/vagueness

</ul>

<div id="Probability and Uncertainty-Uncertainties: Probability Theory-General"><h3 id="General">General</h3></div>
<p>
main interpretations of probability theory:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
optivist (frequentist) probability

<ul>
<li>
frequentism: probability is only property of repeated experiments

<li>
probability of event: limit of <em>relative frequency</em> of occurrence of event, as number of repetitions goes to infinity

</ul>
<li>
subjective probability

<ul>
<li>
Bayesianism: probability is an expression of our uncertainty and beliefs

<li>
probability of event: <em>degree of belief</em> of idealized rational individual

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
sample space Ω: set of single outcomes of experiment
</p>

<p>
event space E: things that have probability (subsets of sample space). if sample space is finite, event space is usually power set.
</p>

<div id="Probability and Uncertainty-Uncertainties: Probability Theory-Axioms of probability"><h3 id="Axioms of probability">Axioms of probability</h3></div>
<p>
for any event A, B:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
\(0 \leq P(A) \leq 1\)

<li>
\(P(\Omega) = 1\)

<li>
\(P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)\)

</ul>

<p>
can derive:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
\(P({}) = 0\)

<li>
\(P(\Omega) = 1\)

<li>
\(\text{if} A \subset B, P(A) \leq P(B)\)

</ul>

<p>
conditional probability ("A given B"):
</p>

<p>
\(P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}\)
</p>

<div id="Probability and Uncertainty-Uncertainties: Probability Theory-Joint probability distributions"><h3 id="Joint probability distributions">Joint probability distributions</h3></div>
<p>
for a set of random variables, it gives probability of every atomic even on those random variables.
</p>

<p>
e.g. P(Toothache, Catch, Cavity):
</p>

<p>
inference by enumeration:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
for any proposition Φ, sum atomic events where it's true -- \(P(\Phi) = \sum_{\omega : \omega \models \Phi} P(\omega)\)

<li>
compute conditional probability by selecting cells -- e.g. for P(¬ cavity | toothache), select toothache column and (¬ cavity) cells

</ul>

<p>
use Bayes' rule for opposite conditionals (like finding P(disease | symptom) from P(symptom | disease))
</p>

<div id="Probability and Uncertainty-Uncertainties: Probability Theory-Bayesian networks"><h3 id="Bayesian networks">Bayesian networks</h3></div>
<p>
simple graphical notation for 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
conditional independence assertions

<li>
compact specification of full joint distributions

</ul>

<p>
syntax:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
set of nodes, one per variable

<li>
directed acyclic graph, with a link meaning "directly influences"

<li>
conditional distribution for each node given its parents -- \(P(X_i | Parents(X_i))\)

</ul>

<p>
topology example:
</p>

<p>
<img src="img/bayesian-topology.png" alt="Bayesian network topology" />
</p>

<p>
what does it mean?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>weather</em> is independent of other variables

<li>
<em>toothache</em> and <em>catch</em> are conditionally independent given <em>cavity</em>.

</ul>

<div id="Probability and Uncertainty-Uncertainties: Probability Theory-Evaluation of probabilities"><h3 id="Evaluation of probabilities">Evaluation of probabilities</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
good -- sound theoretical basis, can be extended to decision-making, some good tools available

<li>
bad -- not always computationally easy, need lots of data which may be hard to get

</ul>

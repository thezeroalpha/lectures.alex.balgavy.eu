# BCH codes
## Finite fields
**Basic roots**
- 1 is root of f(x) ⇒ 1+x is divisor/factor of f(x)
- g(0) = 0 ⇒ x is divisor/factor of g(x)

primitive irreducible polynomial: not divisor of $1+x^{m}$ for m < 2ⁿ-1

in a field, if ab = 0, then a = 0 or b = 0

To make Kⁿ into field, define multiplication in Kⁿ modulo an irreducible polynomial of degree n (gives you GF(2ⁿ)).

## Minimal polynoms
Order of nonzero element α ∈ GF(2ⁿ) is smallest positive int m such that $\alpha^{m} = 1$

Minimal polynomial of α ∈ GF(2ⁿ) is polynomial in K[x] of min degree with α as root

$\alpha^{m} = 1$ ⇒ α is root of $1+x^{m}$

**Facts about minimal polynomials**
- If
    - a ≠ 0 in GF(2ⁿ)
    - & $m_{a} (x)$ minimal polynomial of a
- Then $m_{a} (x)$ is:
    - irreducible over K
    - factor of polynomial f over K where f(a) = 0
    - unique min polynomial
    - factor of $1+x^{2^{r}-1}$

To find min polynomial, find linear combination of {1, a, a², …, $a^{r}$} which sums to 0

**Roots of minimal polynomials**
- If a ∈ GF(2ⁿ) with min polynomial $m_{a (x)}$
- then roots of $m_{x}$ are {a, a², a⁴, …, $a^{2^{r-1}}$}

## Cyclic Hamming codes
primitive polynomial degree r is generator polynomial of a cyclic Hamming code of length $2^{r}-1$.

decoding: if generator polynomial primitive $m_{a} (x)$ and w(x) received, then w(x) = c(x) + e(x) where c(c) is codeword and $e(x) = x^{j}$ (j is the position of 1 in e).

- if c cyclic code length n, generator g(x), and $a \in GF(2^{r})$ is root of g(x)
- then ∀ c(x) ∈ C, c(x) = 0 so $m_{a} (x)$ divisor of c(x)

## BCH codes
Why? Quite easy decoding, class of BCH codes is extensive.

For any positive ints r and t, $t \leq 2^{r-1} - 1$, exists BCH length $n = 2^{r-1}$ which is t-error correcting and dimension k = n - r t.

The 2-error correcting BCH length $2^{r-1}$ is cyclic linear code generated by $g(x) = m_{\beta} (x) m_{\beta^{2}} (x)$, with β primitive element in GF($2^{r}$) and r ≥ 4. g(x) is generator for cyclic code because $n = 2^{r}-1$ and g(x) divides 1+xⁿ.

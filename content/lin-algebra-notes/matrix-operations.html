<div id="Matrix operations"><h2 id="Matrix operations">Matrix operations</h2></div>
<p>
\(a_{ij}\) is the entry in the ith row and jth column of A
</p>

<p>
diagonal entries are \(a_{11}\), \(a_{22}\), etc. and form the main diagonal. if non-diagonal entries are zero, then it's a diagonal matrix.
</p>

<p>
equal matrices have same size <em>and</em> their corresponding entries are equal.
</p>

<div id="Matrix operations-Sums and scalar multiples"><h3 id="Sums and scalar multiples">Sums and scalar multiples</h3></div>
<p>
sum A+B: sum corresponding entries in A and B.
</p>

<p>
scalar multiple \(rA\) is matrix whose columns are r times the corresponding columns in A (with r scalar).
</p>

<p>
the usual rules of algebra apply to sums and scalar multiples of matrices.
</p>

<p>
when matrix B multiplies vector x, it transforms x into vector \(Bx\). if \(Bx\) is multiplied by A, the result is \(A(Bx)\). \(A(Bx)\) is produced from x by composition of mappings, which can be represented as multiplication by a single matrix AB.
</p>

<p>
\(A(Bx) = (AB)x\)
</p>

<p>
\(AB = A \begin{bmatrix} b_1 &amp; b_2 &amp; \dots &amp; b_p \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} Ab_1 &amp; Ab_2 &amp; \dots &amp; Ab_p \end{bmatrix}\)
</p>

<p>
A is matrix, B is matrix with columns \(b_1 \dots b_p\).
</p>

<p>
each column of AB is a linear combination of columns of A using weights from corresponding column of B. AB has the same number of rows as A and same number of columns as B. if the number of columns of A does not match number of rows of B, the product is undefined. in general, AB ≠ BA.
</p>

<p>
if product AB is defined, then:
</p>


<p>
\((AB)_{ij} = a_{i1} b_{1j} + a_{i2} b_{2j} + \dots + a_{in} b_{nj}\)
</p>

<p>
\(row_i (AB) = row_i (A) \times B\)
</p>

<p>
a nifty trick: if multiplying matrix m×n by matrix n×o, the product will be a matrix m×o.

<div id="Matrix operations-Powers of a matrix"><h3 id="Powers of a matrix">Powers of a matrix</h3></div>
<p>
\(A^k = \underbrace{A \dots A}_{k}\)
</p>

<p>
with \(A\) an n × n matrix and k a positive integer.
</p>

<div id="Matrix operations-Transpose of a matrix"><h3 id="Transpose of a matrix">Transpose of a matrix</h3></div>
<p>
a matrix \(A'\) whose columns are made up of the corresponding rows of \(A\)
</p>

<p>
properties:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
\((A^T)^T = A\)

<li>
\((A+B)^T = A^T + B^T\)

<li>
\((rA)^T = rA^T\) with r a scalar

<li>
\((AB)^T = B^T A^T\)$

</ul>

<p>
the transpose of a product of matrices == product of their transposes in reverse order
</p>

<div id="Matrix operations-Inverse of a matrix"><h3 id="Inverse of a matrix">Inverse of a matrix</h3></div>
<p>
invertible (singular) if there is same size matrix C such that \(CA = I\) and \(AC = I\) where I is the n × n identity matrix.
</p>

<p>
identity matrix: a matrix where the diagonals are all 1.
</p>

<p>
C is uniquely determined by A, so: \(A^{-1} A = I\).
</p>

<p>
let \(A = \begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d \end{bmatrix}.\) if \(ad - bc \ne 0\) then \(A^{-1} = \frac{1}{ad - bc} \begin{bmatrix} d &amp; -b \\ -c &amp; a \end{bmatrix}\)
</p>

<p>
determinant: \(\det A = ad - bc\)
</p>

<p>
if A is invertible (determinant is not 0), then for each \(b \in \Re^n\) the solution of \(Ax = b\) is \(A^{-1} b\).
</p>

<p>
properties of inverse:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
\((A^{-1})^{-1} = A\)

<li>
\((AB)^{-1} = B^{-1} A^{-1}\) (watch out for order!)

<li>
\((A^T)^{-1} = (A^{-1})^T\)

</ul>

<p>
finding \(A^{-1}\):
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Row reduce augmented matrix \(\begin{bmatrix} A &amp; I \end{bmatrix}\).

<li>
if A is row equivalent to I, then \(\begin{bmatrix} A &amp; I \end{bmatrix}\) is row equivalent to \(\begin{bmatrix} I &amp; A^{-1} \end{bmatrix}\)

<li>
otherwise, A doesn't have an inverse.

</ul>

<div id="Matrix operations-Elementary matrices"><h3 id="Elementary matrices">Elementary matrices</h3></div>
<p>
elementary matrix: obtained by performing single elementary row operation on identity matrix
</p>

<p>
if elementary row operation is performed on m × n matrix A, result is EA, with E an m × m matrix obtained by performing same row operation on \(I_m\)
</p>

<p>
inverse of any elementary matrix E is of same type that transforms E back into I.
</p>

<p>
an n² matrix A is only invertible if A is row equivalent to \(I_n\). any sequence of elementary operations reducing A to \(I_n\) also transforms \(I_n\) into \(A^{-1}\).

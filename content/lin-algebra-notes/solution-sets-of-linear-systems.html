<p>
homogeneous: if you can write it in \(Ax = 0\) where A is an \(m \times n\) matrix and 0 is the zero vector in \(\Re^m\)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
always has at least one solution (the trivial solution, \(x = 0\)).

<li>
has a nontrivial solution iff there is a free variable

<ul>
<li>
if the equation has only one free variable, the solution is a line through the origin

<li>
when there are two or more free variables, it's a line through the origin

</ul>
<li>
solution set is \(\text{Span} \{v_1, \ldots, v_p\}\) for suitable vectors

</ul>

<div id="Solution sets of linear systems-Parametric vector form"><h3 id="Parametric vector form">Parametric vector form</h3></div>
<p>
implicit description:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
a simple equation

<li>
e.g. \(10x_1 - 3x_2 - 2x_3 = 0\)

</ul>

<p>
explicit description (parametric vector form):
</p>
<ul>
<li>
the solution to the equation as a set spanned by u and v

<li>
of the form \(x = su + tv\), with \(s,t \in \Re\)

</ul>

<p>
the solution set of \(Ax = 0\) is \(x = tv\) with \(t \in \Re\).
</p>

<p>
if \(Ax = b\) has a solution, then you get the solution set by translating the solution set of \(Ax = 0\) using any particular solution p of \(Ax = b\). The set is then \(x = p + tv\)
</p>

<p>
Writing a solution set in parametric vector form:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Row reduce augmented matrix to echelon form

<li>
Express each basic variable in terms of any free variables.

<li>
Write a typical solution x as a vector, with entries depending on the (potential) free variables.

<li>
Decompose x into a linear combination of vectors using free vars as parameters.

</ol>

<div id="Solution sets of linear systems-Linear independence"><h3 id="Linear independence">Linear independence</h3></div>

<p>
linearly independent:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
set of vector equations: iff the vector equation has only the trivial solution (\(x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0\))

<li>
columns of matrix: iff \(Ax = 0\) has <em>only</em> the trivial solution

<li>
one vector: iff v is not the zero vector

<li>
two vectors: if neither of the vectors is a multiple of the other

</ul>

<p>
linearly dependent:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
iff at least one of the vectors is a linear combination of the others

<li>
if there are more vectors than entries in each vector

<li>
if the set contains the zero vector

</ul>

<p>
a set is linearly dependent iff it's not linearly independent.

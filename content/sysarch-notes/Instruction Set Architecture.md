How to program a computer:
1. Create model for programmable digital computer
2. Specify programming interface for each computer

3. Specify a generic programming language that works for all computers (software)

4. Design digital computers that match specific/general interface (hardware)

5. Design software engineering techniques to simplify and optimise coding (software stack)

A platform (simplified) is a set of technologies common to many applications.
ISA: list of instructions a computer can perform, grouped by type

Von Neumann Architecture â€” memory connects to CPU. CPU receives input and sends output.

CPU contains registers, arithmetic and logic unit, control unit.

How to compare ISA:
1. Complexity of what the ISA can do (flexibility)
2. Complexity for programmer (programmability)
3. Complexity for the hardware (implementation cost)

Memory structure:

- 1 byte is 8 bits
- 1 word is 32 bits (4 bytes)- [ ]

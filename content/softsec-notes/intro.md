# Intro
- _error_: made by human
- _bug/vulnerability_: consequence of error
- when the bug is triggered/exploited, generates security _failure_

security is intersection of:
- availability: can be ensure that services can stay available and not be take down by attackers
- confidentiality: can we keep info secret
- integrity: can we keep data from being modified by attackers

Some applications work but have vulnerabilities:
- insecure configs
- systems have a conflicting security policy
- side channels -- e.g. indirect observation of data
- hardware vulnerabilities

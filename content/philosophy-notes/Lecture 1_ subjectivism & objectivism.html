      <div id="rendered-md"><p>cultural relativism: no objective moral standard, only relative to a culture<br>
          ethics: study of moral standards. these standards are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>subjectivism: based on feelings
            <ul>
              <li>example: &quot;boooo i think this sucks&quot;</li>
              <li>can't account for disagreements (if someone criticises you, you could just say &quot;muh culture&quot;)</li>
              <li>even if agreement in <em>belief</em>, may have a conflict of attitudes: I agree you like something, but think you shouldn't and encourage you not to
                <ul>
                  <li>objectivist: &quot;you should change your attitude for good reasons&quot;</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>why people like it: moral standards not 'scientifically testable' so seem up to us</li>
              <li>why people don't: there's stuff that seems clearly criticizable (slavery, racism) for good reasons</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>objectivism: based on reasons
            <ul>
              <li>example: &quot;this objectively sucks for good reasons&quot;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>why ethics? helps resolve moral dilemmas and make decisions in a systematic, intelligent way.</p>

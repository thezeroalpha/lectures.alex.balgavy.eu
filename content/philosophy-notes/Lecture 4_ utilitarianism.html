      <div id="rendered-md"><p>utilitarianism (consequentialism):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>weigh costs/benefits of all options, see which option is best</li>
          <li>only factor that morally matters are consequences of an action on the well-being of everyone, where everyone gets equal consideration.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>comparisons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>vs contractualism: starts from assumption that everyone matters equally, while contractualism says that we should do what's in self-interest.</li>
          <li>vs ethical egoism: looks at well-being of everyone involved, not just own well-being.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&quot;well-being&quot; has different meanings, in principle any of the ones mentioned in <a data-from-md data-resource-id='97ee2dae8b644b3b802094b618067169' title='' href='Lecture 3_ theories of well-being.html' type=''>Lecture 3: theories of well-being</a> can be used<br>
          if you don't know how an act will play out, you have to work with all of the <em>potential</em> consequences.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>that doesn't mean we can't take risks</li>
          <li>don't always evaluate this, sometimes it takes long time to evaluate all possible consequences, and you won't have time to act</li>
        </ul>
        <p>how do you approach issues of e.g. health vs privacy (like tracking people with Corona)?<br>
          utilitarians: weigh costs/benefits of mass surveillance vs other strategies</p>
        <ul>
          <li>but how assign costs to mass surveillance if don't know what's valuable about privacy?</li>
          <li>argument: I have nothing to hide, please track me
            <ul>
              <li>counter 1: prevention of harm - info you share now might be used against you later</li>
              <li>counter 2: intentional inequity - usually citizens don't see how their data is used</li>
              <li>counter 3: injustice and discrimination - personal data can be used to discriminate against you</li>
              <li>counter 4: autonomy and human dignity - mass surveillance threatens our image of private mental life</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>problems for utilitarianism:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>&quot;an individual's rights may be trampled upon if enough other people benefit&quot; (e.g. killing one person with a rare blood type to transplant their organs and save 5 other people)
            <ul>
              <li>response 1: violating people's rights will typically not have the best consequences (e.g. if sacrificing people was common, society would be in stress and fear)</li>
              <li>response 2: update view so it's typically not ok to violate people's rights. i.e. maximize everyone's well-being, where everyone gets equal consideration</li>
              <li>response 3: in some select cases, people's rights may be violated (like with the privacy issue)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

    <div class="exported-note"><h1>Lecture 3: theories of well-being</h1>

      <div id="rendered-md"><p>theories don't necessarily disagree, but if they agree, they agree for different reasons.</p>
        <p>utilitarianism justifies choices by referring to well-being of everyone involved.<br>
          but what is well-being? what's ultimately good for one?</p>
        <h2 id="hedonism">Hedonism</h2>
        <p>your well-being depends on whether you enjoy your life.<br>
          something matters because it brings you pleasure.<br>
          but pleasure is valuable in itself.</p>
        <p>but if you had an experience machine that could give you any experience you wanted, would you plug in?<br>
          why not, based on Nozick:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>I want to be someone, not just a set of experiences
            <ul>
              <li>but there could be a machine in which we could be transformed into any character we ant</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>I want to do things, achieve things through pain and effort, not just sit and wait for things to happen.
            <ul>
              <li>but there could be a machine in which we work on and <em>accomplish</em> all sorts of great projects</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>I want contact with reality, not a reality restricted to what humans can imagine and program.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="preference-satisfaction">Preference satisfaction</h2>
        <p>your well-being depends on whether you get what you want.<br>
          life goes better if more of your preferences are satisfied<br>
          i.e. not just about pleasure.</p>
        <p>is it always good to get what you want? people make bad choices...maybe because they are misinformed?<br>
          amend: what matters is if your laundered preferences are satisfied (i.e. those you'd have if you were sufficiently informed).</p>
        <p>policies can influence people's preferences.<br>
          some might seem good, like smokers losing their desire for smoking.<br>
          but what's the justification? at what point does it just become propaganda, i.e. people like stuff because of the policy?<br>
          though preference satisfaction says it's good if people get what they want after being informed, not after having their desires manipulated.</p>
        <p>also, what if someone's only fully-informed desire is to count blades of grass?<br>
          if life going well for this person if they get all the time to count blades of grass?<br>
          based on preference satisfaction, yes.<br>
          but like, for real?</p>
        <h2 id="objective-list-theory">Objective list theory</h2>
        <p>your well-being depends on whether you have the items that are on the objective list.<br>
          i.e. there are things that are good for everyone.</p>
        <p>so what's on the list?<br>
          based on Martha Nussbaum:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>life: being able to live a life of normal length</li>
          <li>health: good health, including reproductive</li>
          <li>bodily integrity: being able to move freely, be secure against assault/violence, and having opportunities for sexual satisfaction</li>
          <li>senses, imagination, thought: being bale to use senses, to imagine, to think and reason with adequate education; being able to experience and produce self-expressive works of religion/literature/music/etc.; being able to have pleasurable experiences and avoid unnecessary pain.</li>
          <li>emotions: being able to have attachments to other things and people, to love, to grieve, to experience justified anger</li>
          <li>practical reason: being able to form conception of good, and to engage in critical reflection about planning of one's life</li>
          <li>affiliation: being able to live with/toward others, to show concern for other people, being able to work as a human being, having social bases of self-respect and non-humiliation</li>
          <li>other species: being able to live with concern for and relation to animals, plants, and nature.</li>
          <li>play: being able to laugh, play, enjoy recreational activities.</li>
          <li>control over one's environment: political (participating in political choices, protections of free speech and association), material (being able to have property, having right to equally seek employment, having freedom from unwarranted search and seizure)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>advantage: this view might be more suitable for policy.<br>
          disadvantage: less room for choice and diversity.</p>

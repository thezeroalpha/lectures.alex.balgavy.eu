# Lecture 1: subjectivism & objectivism
cultural relativism: no objective moral standard, only relative to a culture

ethics: study of moral standards. these standards are:
- subjectivism: based on feelings
  - example: "boooo i think this sucks"
  - can't account for disagreements (if someone criticises you, you could just say "muh culture")
  - even if agreement in _belief_, may have a conflict of attitudes: I agree you like something, but think you shouldn't and encourage you not to
    - objectivist: "you should change your attitude for good reasons"
  - why people like it: moral standards not 'scientifically testable' so seem up to us
  - why people don't: there's stuff that seems clearly criticizable (slavery, racism) for good reasons
- objectivism: based on reasons
  - example: "this objectively sucks for good reasons"

why ethics? helps resolve moral dilemmas and make decisions in a systematic, intelligent way.

Todo:
- read chapter 2 (challenge of cultural relativism):

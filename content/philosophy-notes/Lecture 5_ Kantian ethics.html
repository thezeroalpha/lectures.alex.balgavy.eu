      <div id="rendered-md"><p>Kantian ethics: asks about intentions for action - are they good or bad?<br>
          contracts or consequences don't matter.</p>
        <p>how do you judge your intentions?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>formula of humanity: whether you disrespect others and use them against their will for your purposes
            <ul>
              <li>humanity should be used as an end, not only as a means</li>
              <li>if you're using someone only as a means, you don't care about their consent</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>formula of universal law: whether you make an exception for yourself
            <ul>
              <li>only act on intentions (maxims) that could be universal (i.e. you'd be fine if everyone did it)</li>
              <li>i.e. if everyone does some action, would you still be able to achieve your goal by doing the same? if not, don't do the action.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>in summary: we shouldn't think we are more important than others. respect others and don't make exceptions for yourself.</p>

# Lecture 5: Kantian ethics
Kantian ethics: asks about intentions for action - are they good or bad?
contracts or consequences don't matter.

how do you judge your intentions?
- formula of humanity: whether you disrespect others and use them against their will for your purposes
    - humanity should be used as an end, not only as a means
    - if you're using someone only as a means, you don't care about their consent
- formula of universal law: whether you make an exception for yourself
    - only act on intentions (maxims) that could be universal (i.e. you'd be fine if everyone did it)
    - i.e. if everyone does some action, would you still be able to achieve your goal by doing the same? if not, don't do the action.

in summary: we shouldn't think we are more important than others. respect others and don't make exceptions for yourself.

<p>
main activities:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
requirements engineering

<ul>
<li>
specifies the main functionalities of the system

<li>
defines the qualities to be met

</ul>
<li>
design

<ul>
<li>
give shape to a system via models

<li>
not a clear-cut sequential process

</ul>
<li>
implementation and testing

<ul>
<li>
involves actual development of the system

<li>
component testing – test individual components independently

<li>
system testing – test the system as a whole (including emergent properties like overall performance)

<li>
acceptance testing – test with customer data to see if the system meets the customer's needs

</ul>
<li>
evolution

<ul>
<li>
software is inherently flexible and can change

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
exists in many variants, all with sequential flow. it's document-driven.
</p>

<p>
issues: poor agility (when do you know how far you are in the project?), poor quality (cuts if you run out of time), high risk (finding issues in test phase)
</p>

<p>
critical evaluation:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
positive:

<ul>
<li>
precise planning and management – standard-oriented

<li>
postpone implementation to after understanding objectives

<li>
good documentation

</ul>
<li>
negative:

<ul>
<li>
hard to get all requirements once and for all (users might not even know what they want)

<li>
rigid

<li>
no feedback from the customer

<li>
no parallelism, all phases are blocking (because sequential)

<li>
a single delivery date at the end

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Software development process-Agile development process"><h3 id="Agile development process">Agile development process</h3></div>
<p>
iterative development processes with:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
frequent releases of the product

<li>
continuous interaction between dev team and customer

<li>
reduced product documentation

<li>
continuous and systematic assessment of produced value and risks

</ul>

<p>
agile in practice:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
make a list

<li>
estimate

<li>
set priorities

<li>
start executing

<li>
update the plan at run time

</ul>

<p>
critical evaluation:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
positive:

<ul>
<li>
acceptance of change – less risky

<li>
frequent and short iterations

<li>
emphasis on working code

<li>
associates a test with every piece of functionality

<li>
continuous integration and delivery

</ul>
<li>
negative:

<ul>
<li>
feature-based development &amp; ignorance of dependencies

<li>
no strong quality plan

<li>
less focus on architecture of system (in fact, dismisses everything that isn't shippable)

</ul>
</ul>

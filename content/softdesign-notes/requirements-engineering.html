<div id="Requirements engineering with UML-What is UML?"><h3 id="What is UML?">What is UML?</h3></div>
<p>
A unified modeling language, the defacto standard for software design.
</p>

<p>
pros:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
not tied to a development process

<li>
can be used across the whole life cycle

<li>
general purpose, can model all sorts of shit

<li>
has different representations (graphical, but also text)

</ul>

<p>
main characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
comprehensive: can describe all parts of a system

<li>
scalable: "zoom in" and add more details if you want

<li>
originally intended for descriptive models

<li>
now also supports prescriptive models

</ul>

<p>
formal modeling language — its core concepts have a well-defined meaning
</p>

<p>
UML model is represented graphically with diagrams
</p>

<p>
The different types:
</p>

<p>
<img src="img/uml-diagrams.png" alt="Diagram of diagrams" />
</p>

<p>
The ones we will use:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
use case diagram: to specify the basic functionality of a software system (requirements)

<li>
class diagram: to define data structures within the system

<li>
state machine diagram: to define intra-object behavior

<li>
sequence diagram: to specify inter-object behavior and communication

</ul>

<p>
a UML <em>model</em> contains everything related to the system. a <em>diagram</em> is just a "window" on the model (shows some parts, but not necessarily everything).
</p>

<div id="Requirements engineering with UML-Requirements engineering"><h3 id="Requirements engineering">Requirements engineering</h3></div>
<p>
the process of establishing:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
features that a system should and will have

<li>
constraints under which it operates and is developed

</ul>

<p>
requirement can range between:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
high-level abstract statement of a feature

<li>
detailed mathematical functional specification

</ul>

<p>
functional (what) vs non-functional (how) requirements
</p>
<ul>
<li>
functional: services the system should provide, how it should react to inputs, how it should behave in specific situations, opt. what it shouldn't do.

<ul>
<li>
precise — ambiguous requirements may be interpreted in different ways by developers and users

<li>
complete — they should include descriptions of <em>all</em> facilities required

<li>
consistent — there should be no conflicts or contradictions in descriptions of system facilities

<li>
verifiable — requirements should be directly mapped to parts of system

</ul>
<li>
non-functional: constraints on services/functions offered by the system, often apply to system as a whole instead of individual features/services

<ul>
<li>
system properties and constraints (e.g. reliability, response time, storage requirements)

<li>
may be more critical than functional, like safety requirements

<li>
may affect overall architecture of a system instead of individual components (like organization to minimize communications between robots)

<li>
different types:

Natural language
</td>

Use numbered sentences in natural language. Each sentence is one requirement.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Structured natural language.
</td>
<td>
Requirements are written in natural language on standard form/template. Each field gives info about an aspect of the requirement.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Design description languages
</td>
<td>
Use language like programming language, but with more abstract features specifying requirements by defining an operational model of the system.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Graphical notations
</td>
<td>
Graphical models with text annotations. e.g. UML use case and sequence diagrams.
</td>

<tr>

Mathematical specifications

<td>
Based on math concepts like finite-state machines or sets. Most customers don't understand this so not often used.

<div id="Requirements engineering with UML-Requirements engineering-Natural language specification"><h4 id="Natural language specification">Natural language specification</h4></div>
<p>
requirements are written as natural language sentences. used because it's expressive, intuitive, universal, easily understood by customers.
</p>

<p>
guidelines:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
invent a standard format, use it for all requirements.

<li>
use language in a consistent way ("shall" for mandatory requirements, "should" for desirable requirements)

<li>
highlight text to identify important parts of requirement

<li>
avoid use of computer jargon

<li>
include explanation (rationale) of why a requirement is needed

</ul>

<div id="Requirements engineering with UML-Requirements engineering-Use case diagrams"><h4 id="Use case diagrams">Use case diagrams</h4></div>
<p>
express expectations of customers/stakeholders.
</p>

<p>
answers questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
what is being described? (the system)

<li>
who interacts with the system? (the actors)

<li>
what can the actors do? (use cases)

</ul>

<p>
use case:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
describes functionality expected from system under development

<li>
set of all use cases describes functionality that a system shall provide.

<li>
notations:

</ul>
<blockquote>
<img src="img/use-case-notations.png" alt="Use case notations" />
</blockquote>

<p>
actors:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
interact with the system by using use cases, or by being used by use cases.

<li>
represent roles that users adopt (users can have multiple roles)

<li>
not part of the system, so outside of system boundaries.

<li>
human or non-human

<li>
primary/secondary:

<ul>
<li>
if primary, has main benefit of execution of use case.

<li>
if secondary, receives no direct benefit.

</ul>
<li>
active or passive

<ul>
<li>
active: initiates execution of the use case

<li>
passive: provides functionality for the execution of the use case

</ul>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<img src="img/actor-notations.png" alt="Actor notations" />
</blockquote>

<p>
relationships between use cases and actors:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
actors are connected with use cases via associations (solid lines)

<li>
every actors has to communicate with at least one use case

<li>
association is always binary, multiplicities can be specified

</ul>
<blockquote>
<img src="img/usecase-actor-rel.png" alt="Relationships between actors and use cases" />
</blockquote>

<p>
relationships between use cases:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
«include»

<ul>
<li>
behavior of one use case ('included') <em>is always</em> integrated in the behavior of another use case ('base')

</ul>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<img src="img/usecase-include-rel.png" alt="Include relationship" />
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
«extend»

<ul>
<li>
behavior of one use case ('extending') <em>may be</em> integrated in behavior of another use case ('base')

<li>
both use cases can also be executed independently of each other

<li>
extension points are written directly in the use case. you can specify multiple extension points.

</ul>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<img src="img/use-case-extensions.png" alt="Extensions in use cases" />
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
generalization of use cases

<ul>
<li>
if use case A generalizes use case B, then B inherits behavior of A and may extend/overwrite it. B also inherits all relationships form A.

<li>
A may be labeled {abstract} — cannot be executed directly, only B is executable

</ul>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<img src="img/usecase-generalisation.png" alt="Generalisation" />
</blockquote>

<p>
relationships between actors
</p>
<ul>
<li>
generalization

<ul>
<li>
actor A inherits from actor B. e.g. A can communicate with X and Y, B can only communicate with Y.

<li>
abstract actors are possible

</ul>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<img src="img/actor-generalization.png" alt="Actor generalization" />
</blockquote>

<p>
Description of use cases:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Name

<li>
Short description

<li>
Precondition: prerequisite for successful execution

<li>
Postcondition: system state after successful execution

<li>
Error situations: errors relevant to problem domain

<li>
System state on occurrence of an error

<li>
Actors that communicate with the use case

<li>
Trigger: events which initiate the use case

<li>
Standard process: individual steps to be taken

<li>
Alternative processes: deviations from the standard process

</ul>

<p>
Remember, it's an abstraction. Many small use cases with the same objective should be grouped. Don't decompose functionality into use cases.

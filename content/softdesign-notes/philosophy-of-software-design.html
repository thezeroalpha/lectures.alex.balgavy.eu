<ul>
<li>
Complexity is incremental, even small things make a difference

<li>
Working code isn't enough, don't introduce complexity just to finish faster

<li>
Make continual small investments to improve system design

<li>
Modules should be deep (provide powerful functionality, yet have simple interfaces)

<li>
Interfaces should be designed to make most common usage as simple as possible

<li>
simple interace &gt; simple implementation (for a module)

<li>
General-purpose modules are deeper

<li>
Separate general-purpose and special-purpose code

<li>
Different layers should have different abstractions. If two adjacent layers have similar abstractions, there's probably a probem with class decomposition.

<li>
Pull complexity downward, make life as easy as possible for the user

<li>
Define errors (and special cases) out of existence (when they pop up)

<li>
Design it twice, consider multiple options for each major design decision

<li>
Comments should describe things that are not obvious from the code

<li>
Software should be designed for ease of reading, not ease of writing

<li>
Increments of software development should be abstractions, not features. It's ok to put off an abstraction until it's needed by a feature, but once it's needed, take the time to design it cleanly.

</ul>

<div id="Philosophy of Software Design-Summary of red flags"><h2 id="Summary of red flags">Summary of red flags</h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
Shallow module: one whose interface is complicated relative to the functionality it provides

<li>
Information leakage: when the same knowledge is used in multiple places (e.g. two different classes both understand format of a particular type of file)

<li>
Temporal decomposition: execution order is reflected in the code structure, which can lead to information leakage

<li>
Overexposure: if API for commonly used features forces users to learn about other features that are rarely used, it increases cognotive load on the users

<li>
Repetition: if the same piece of code appears multiple times, you probably haven't found the right abstraction

<li>
Special-general mixture: when a general-purpose mechanism contains code specialised for a particular use of that mechanism, which makes it more complicated and creates information leakage

<li>
Conjoined methods: it should be possible to understand each method independently, and if you can't, that's a red flag

<li>
Comment repeats code: if information in a comment is already obvious from the code, that comment is useless

<li>
Implementation documentation contaminates interface: when interface documentation describes implementation details that aren't needed to use what's being documented

<li>
Vague name: if variable/method name is broad enough to refer to different things, it doesn't convey much info to the developer

<li>
Hard to pick name: if it's hard to find a simple name for variable/method that creates a clear image of the underlying object, the underlying object may not have a clean design

<li>
Hard to describe: comment describing method/variable should be simple and complete. If that's hard, there may be a problem with what you're describing

<li>
Nonobvious code: if meaning and behavior of code can't be understood when skimming, it's a red flag.

</ul>

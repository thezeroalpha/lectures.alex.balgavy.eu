<p>
software engineering: the application of engineering to software. a programmer writes a complete program, a software engineer creates a component.
</p>

<p>
engineers abstract away from details that can be <em>safely</em> ignored.
</p>

<p>
model: simplified/partial representation of reality, defined to accomplish a task or reach an agreement
</p>

<p>
abstraction: generalizing – setting aside specific and individual features
</p>

<p>
software design: creating models representing an abstract view of the system
</p>

<p>
what is a model?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
mapping feature: a model is based on an original

<li>
reduction feature: a model only reflects a relevant selection of the original's properties

<li>
pragmatic feature: a model needs to be usable in place of an original with respect to some purpose

</ul>

<p>
consumer and intent influence the abstraction level of a model
</p>

<p>
descriptive models:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
a subject is described by the model

<li>
sketches and throw-away models – short life time, used to better understand the reality

<li>
models of ideas and vision about the system to be developed – to exploit model for having feedback before actually implementing the system

<li>
models extracted from a running system or code – e.g. to visualize all calls between Java classes

</ul>

<p>
prescriptive models:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
a model prescribes the subject

<li>
the subject does not yet exist

<li>
the models guide the development of the system

<li>
most common consumers are code generators

<li>
often used for development, so their importance may decay when the system is implemented

</ul>

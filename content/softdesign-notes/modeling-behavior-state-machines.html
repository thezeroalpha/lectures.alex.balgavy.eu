<p>
every object has finite set of states during life.
</p>

<p>
state machine diagram is used to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
model possible states of system/object

<li>
show how state transitions occur as consequence of events

<li>
show behavior of system in each state

</ul>

<p>

<div id="Modeling behavior with UML State Machines-States"><h3 id="States">States</h3></div>
<p>
states are the nodes of state machine
</p>

<p>
when a state is active:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
object is in that state

<li>
all internal activities in that state can be executed:

<ul>
<li>
<code>entry/Activity</code> - when object enters the state

<li>
<code>do/Activity</code> - while object remains in this state

<li>
<code>exit/Activity</code> - when object exits the state

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Modeling behavior with UML State Machines-Transitions"><h3 id="Transitions">Transitions</h3></div>
<p>
change from one state to another
</p>

</p>

<p>
Syntax of transitions:
</p>
<blockquote>
<img src="img/syntax-of-transitions.png" alt="Syntax of transitions" />
</blockquote>
    
<ul>
<li>
Event (trigger)

<ul>
<li>
can trigger state transition

</ul>
<li>
Guard (condition)

<ul>
<li>
boolean expression

<li>
if event occurs, guard is checked

<li>
if guard is true:

<ol>
<li>
all activities in current state are terminated

<li>
exit activity is executed

<li>
transition happens

</ol>
</ul>
<li>
Activity (effect)

<ul>
<li>
sequence of actions that happen during transition

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Types:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
internal:

</ul>
<blockquote>
<img src="img/internal-state-transition.png" alt="Internal state transition" />
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
if <code>event1</code> happens, object stays in <code>state1</code> and <code>Activity3</code> runs

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
external:

</ul>
<blockquote>
<img src="img/external-state-transition.png" alt="External state transition" />
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
if <code>event1</code> happens:

<ul>
<li>
object leaves <code>state1</code>, <code>Activity2</code> runs

<li>
<code>Activity3</code> runs

<li>
object enters <code>state1</code> and <code>Activity1</code> runs

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Timing of transitions:

<span id="Modeling behavior with UML State Machines-Types of events-Time event:"></span><strong id="Time event:">Time event:</strong> time-based state transition (relative or absolute time)

<li>
<span id="Modeling behavior with UML State Machines-Types of events-Any receive event:"></span><strong id="Any receive event:">Any receive event:</strong> when any event occurs that doesn't trigger another transition from the active state

<li>
<span id="Modeling behavior with UML State Machines-Types of events-Change event:"></span><strong id="Change event:">Change event:</strong> permanently checking when a condition becomes true

</ul>

<p>
A change event is permanently checked. A guard is only checked when the event occurs.
</p>

<div id="Modeling behavior with UML State Machines-Types of states"><h3 id="Types of states">Types of states</h3></div>
<p>
Initial state:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
"start" of the diagram

<li>
pseudo-state, system can't remain in this state

<li>
no incoming edges

<li>
outgoing edges have to be mutually exclusive and at least one target must be reachable. no events allowed.

<li>
system immediately switches from initial state.

<li>
notation: <img src="img/initial-state-notation.png" alt="Initial state notation" />

</ul>

<p>
Final state:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
real state

<li>
end of sequence of states

<li>
can remain in this state forever

<li>
notation: <img src="img/final-state-notation.png" alt="Final state notation" />

</ul>

<p>
Terminate node:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
pseudo-state

<li>
terminates state machine

<li>
modeled object is deleted

<li>
notation: <img src="img/terminate-node-notation.png" alt="Terminate node notation" />

</ul>

<p>
Decision node:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
pseudo-state

<li>
used for alternative transitions

<li>
notation: <img src="img/decision-node-notation.png" alt="Decision node notation" />

</ul>

<p>
Parallelization node:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
pseudo-state

<li>
splits control flow into multiple concurrent flows

<li>
1 incoming edge, &gt;1 outgoing edges

<li>
notation: <img src="img/parallelization-node-notation.png" alt="Parallelization node notation" />

</ul>

<p>
Synchronization node:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
pseudo-state

<li>
merges multiple concurrent flows

<li>
&gt;1 incoming edge, 1 outgoing edge

<li>
notation: <img src="img/synchronization-node-notation.png" alt="Synchronization node notation" />

</ul>

<p>
Composite state:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
contains substates, with only one of them active at any time

<li>
arbitrary nesting depth

<li>
higher level events take priority

</ul>
<blockquote>
<img src="img/composite-state-diagram.png" alt="Composite state diagram" />
</blockquote>
    
<p>
Orthogonal state:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
composite state divided into two or more regions, separated by dashed line

<li>
one state of each region is always active at some point (concurrent substates)

<li>
final state has to be reached in all regions to trigger completion

</ul>
<blockquote>
<img src="img/orthogonal-state-diagram.png" alt="Orthogonal state diagram" />
</blockquote>

<p>
Submachine state (SMS)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
to reuse parts of state machine diagrams in other ones

<li>
as soon as submachine state is activated, behavior of submachine is executed (subroutine)

<li>
notation: <code>state:submachineState</code>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<img src="img/submachine-state-diagram.png" alt="Submachine state diagram" />
</blockquote>

<p>
History state:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
remembers the last active substate of a composite state

<li>
activates 'old' substate and all entry activities run sequentially from outside to inside of composite state

<li>
exactly one outgoing edge of history state points to a substate. used if the composite state was never active, or it was exited via final state.

<li>
shallow history state restores state on the same level of the composite state (<code>H</code>)

<li>
deep history state restores last active substate over <em>all levels</em> (<code>H*</code>)

</ul>

<div id="Modeling behavior with UML State Machines-Entry and exit points"><h3 id="Entry and exit points">Entry and exit points</h3></div>
<p>
Encapsulation mechanism: a composite state shall be entered/exited via a state other than initial and final states.
</p>

<p>
external transition must/need not know structure of composite state.

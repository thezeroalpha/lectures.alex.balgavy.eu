== Structure modeling with UML ==

=== Class ===

a construction plan for a set of similar objects of a system

{{file:img/uml-class.png|UML Class Diagram}}

==== Attribute syntax ====

{{file:img/uml-attribute-syntax.png|UML Attribute Syntax}}

Visibility: who is permitted to access the attribute
    * `+` public, everybody
    * `-` private, only the object itself
    * `#` protected, class itself and subclasses
    * `~` package, classes that are in the same package

`/` means that attribute value is derived from other attributes

Type:
    * primitive data type
        * pre-defined: Boolean, Integer, UnlimitedNatural, String
        * User-defined: «primitive»
        * composite: «datatype»
    * enumerations: «enumeration»

    {{file:img/uml-data-types.png|UML Data Types}}

Multiplicity: number of values an attribute may contain (as [min..max], max can be `*` meaning no limit)

`= Default`: the default value that's used if the user doesn't explicitly set a value

properties:
    * `[readOnly]` - value can't be changed
    * `[unique]` - no duplicates allowed
    * `[non-unique]` - duplicates allowed
    * `[ordered]` - fixed order of values
    * `[unordered]` - no fixed order of values

==== Operation syntax ====

{{file:img/uml-operation-syntax.png|UML operation syntax}}

Similar to attributes.

parameter:
    * direction
        * `in`: input parameter (value is expected)
        * `out`: output parameter (adopts a new value after execution of operation)
        * `inout`: combined input/output

{{file:img/uml-operation-parameter-notation.png|UML operation parameter notation}}

type: type of return value

==== Class variable and class operation ====
Class variable (static): defined only once per class, shared by all instances

Class operation (static): can be used without creating an instance

To distinguish class variables/operations, underline them.

=== Relationships ===

==== Binary association ====
Connects instances of two classes with one another.

{{file:img/uml-class-binary-association.png|UML Class Binary association}}

Properties:
    * Navigability: an object knows its partner objects, can access their visible attributes and operations (open arrow head, if not then cross). If undefined, bidirectional is assumed.
    * Multiplicity: number of objects that can be associated with exactly one object of the opposite side (e.g. one-to-one, one-to-many...)
    * Role: how an object is involved in an association relationship
    * `xor` constraint: cannot be associated with both at the same time

in Java:

{{{
class Professor {...}

class Student {
    public Professor[] lecturer;
}
}}}

==== n-ary association ====
More than two objects involved in the relationship, no navigation directions.

{{file:img/uml-class-ternary-association.png|UML Class Ternary Association}}

==== Association class ====
Assign attributes to relationship between classes instead of to a class.

{{file:img/uml-class-association-class.png|UML Class Association class}}

Needed for n:m associations.

Association class vs regular class:

{{file:img/uml-class-association-vs-regular.png|UML Class Association vs regular}}

Can be unique or non-unique.

==== Aggregation ====
Shows that class is part of another class.

Properties:
    * transitive: if B is part of A and C is part of B, C is also part of A
    * asymmetric: not possible for A to be part of B and B to be part of A at the same time

===== Shared aggregation =====
expresses weak belonging of the parts to a whole (parts also exist independently of the whole). one element can be part of multiple other elements at the same time.

Example:

{{file:img/uml-class-shared-aggregation-example.png|UML Class shared aggregation example}}

===== Composition =====
existence dependency between composite object and its parts. one part can be contained in max one composite object at a point in time. if the composite object is deleted, so are its parts.

A `Tire` can exist without a `Car`. A `Tire` belongs to max one `Car`:

{{file:img/uml-class-composition-example.png|UML Class composition example}}

==== Generalization ====
stuff from a superclass is passed to its subclass (attributes, operations, associations, aggregations)

every instance of a subclass is simultaneously an indirect instance of the superclass. subclass inherits all characteristics except private ones. generalizations are transitive. a class may have multiple superclasses/subclasses.

{{file:img/uml-class-generalisation.png|UML Class generalisation}}

abstract class ensures that there are no direct instances of the superclass.

=== Creating a class diagram ===
nouns often indicate classes. adjectives indicate attribute values. verbs indicate operations.

in general, tend towards having deep classes. push complexity as low as possible in the class diagram hierarchy.

focus on:
    * responsibility of each class (private is default, `getter` and `setter` methods)
    * knowledge needed by each class (tend toward generality, don't focus on order of tasks)
    * usability of operations of each class (exposed APIs should be as easy and intuitive as possible

generalization: "there is difference between research and administrative employees. some research associates hold courses, so they are lecturers."

{{file:img/uml-natural-text-generalization.png|UML Natural text generalization}}

composition: "a university consists of multiple faculties which are composed of various institutes."

{{file:img/uml-natural-text-composition.png|UML Natural text composition}}

binary association: "each faculty is led by a dean, who is an employee of the university"

{{file:img/uml-natural-text-binary-association.png|UML Natural text binary association}}

shared aggregation: "research associates are assigned to at least one institute"

{{file:img/uml-natural-text-shared-aggregation.png|UML Natural text shared aggregation}}

association class: "research associates can be involved in projects for a certain number of hours"

{{file:img/uml-natural-text-association-class.png|UML Natural text association class}}

generalization: "some research associates hold courses. then they are called lecturers."

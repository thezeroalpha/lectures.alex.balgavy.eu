== Incompleteness theorem ==
Consider sets of function and predicate symbols:
  * F = {0, S, +, ·}
  * P = {<}

with as intended model number theory N:
  * domain of N is the natural numbers with 0
  * $0^\mathbb{N} = 0$
  * $S^\mathbb{N} (n) = n + 1$
  * $+^\mathbb{N} (n,m) = n+m$
  * $\mathbb{N}(n,m) = n \cdot m$
  * $<^\mathbb{N} = \{ <n,m> | n,m \in \mathbb{N} \text{ such that }n < m \}$

One would like to have complete theory (deduction system) ⊢ for N that allows to derive all formulas that are true in N.

First incompleteness theorem:
  * every axiomatizable and sound theory ⊢ of first-order logic
  * for number theory with language <F,P>
  * is incomplete:
    * it contains sentences Φ that are true in N, but unprovable in ⊢: N ⊨ Φ, yet ⊬ Φ.


Second incompleteness theorem:
  * for every axiomatizable theory ⊢ of first-order logic
  * for number theory with language <F,P>
  * that is rich enough to express its own consistency by a sentence Φ⊢
  * it holds that either:
    * ⊢ ⊥ (⊢ is inconsistent)
    * ⊬ Φ⊢ (hence ⊢ is incomplete)
  * so first-order theories (based on predicate logic) of number theory can't prove their own consistency

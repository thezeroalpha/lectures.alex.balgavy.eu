Entailment syntactically (⊢) and semantically (⊨)
  * Γ ⊢ ψ: there is natural deduction derivation of ψ that only uses premises in Γ
  * Γ ⊨ ψ: for all M and l, if M ⊨l Φ for every Φ ∈ Γ, then M ⊨ ψ

Soundness and completeness:
  * Γ ⊢ Φ ⇔ Γ ⊨ Φ
  * for all formulas Φ, every set Γ of formulas
  * soundness (correctness): left-to-right (⇒)
  * completeness: right-to-left (⇐)

soundness theorem:
  * Γ ⊢ Φ ⇒ Γ ⊨ Φ
  * if there is natural deduction derivation of Φ from Γ, then there's no model M in which all formulas of Γ are true, but Φ is false
  * "correct" means not possible to derive false conclusion Φ from true premises Γ
  * prove by induction on derivation lengths

completeness theorem:
  * Γ ⊨ Φ ⇒ Γ ⊢ Φ
  * derivations are strong enough to derive all valid semantic entailment statements
  * "complete" means more derivation rules are not necessary
  * proof is non-trivial

consistency and syntactical consistency
  * Γ is consistent ⇔ Γ is syntactically consistent
  * Γ has a model ⇔ there is no derivation of ⊥ from Γ

semantical consistency:
  * set Γ of formulas is consistent if there is model M and environment l such that M ⊨ Φ for all Φ ∈ Γ

syntactical consistency:
  * set Γ of formulas is syntactically consistent if Γ ⊬ ⊥

compactness theorem:
  * Γ is consistent ⇔ every finite subset Γ₀ ⊆ Γ si consistent

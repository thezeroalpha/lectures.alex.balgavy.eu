== Sets ==
Recap from logic and sets:
    * empty set Ø = {x | false}
    * universal set U = {x | true}
    * union A ∪ B = {x | x ∈ A or x ∈ B}
    * intersection A ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}
    * complement Ā = {x | x ∉ A}
    * difference A \ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∉ B}

Theorems:
    * A ∩ (B ∪ C) = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C)
    * (A \ B) \ C = A \ (B ∪ C)

=== Relations ===
definitions of properties:
  * reflexive: ∀x R(x,x)
  * symmetric: ∀x ∀y (R(x,y) → R(y,x))
  * transitive: ∀x ∀y ∀z ((R(x,y) ∧ R(y,z)) → R(x,z))
  * serial: ∀x ∃y R(x,y)
  * functional: ∀x ∃y (R(x,y) ∧ ∀z (R(x,z) → z=y))

==== Order types ====
partial order:
    * reflexive
    * transitive
    * antisymmetric

total order:
    * partial order
    * ∀ a,b (R(a,b) ∨ R(b,a))

strict partial order: partial order but irreflexive

strict total order:
    * strict partial order
    * ∀ a,b (R(a,b) ∨ (a=b) ∨ R(b,a))

equivalence relation:
    * reflexive (∀a, a ≡ A)
    * symmetric
    * transitive

=== Natural numbers & induction ===
Set of natural numbers is N ∈ (0,∞)

Principle of induction: let P be a property of natural numbers. Suppose P holds for zero, and whenever P holds for a natural number n, then it holds for its successor n+1. Then P holds for every natural number.

As a natural deduction rule:

=== Recursive definitions ===
Let A be any set, suppose a is in A, and g: N × A → A. Then there is a unique function f satisfying:
    * f(0) = a
    * f(n+1) = g(n, f(n))

Typically to prove something about a recursively defined function is to use induction.

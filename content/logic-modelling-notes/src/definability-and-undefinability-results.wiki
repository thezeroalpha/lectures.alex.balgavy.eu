=== for model cardinality ===
model cardinality:

{{local:../img/model-cardinality-definition.png|Model cardinality definition}}


for all models M and all n ≥ 2 it holds that:
  * M ⊨ Φn ⇔ A has at least n elements
  * M ⊨ ψn ⇔ A has at most n elements
  * M ⊨ Φn ∧ ψn ⇔ A has precisely n elements

model infiniteness is definable by a set of formulas Δ:
  * M ⊨ Δ ⇔ M has an infinite domain

model finiteness is undefinable (single formula):
  * there's no sentence ψ such that
  * all M: M ⊨ ψ ⇔ M has a finite domain

model finiteness is undefinable (set of formulas):
  * there's no set of formulas Γ such that
  * all M: M ⊨ Γ ⇔ M has a finite domain

mode infiniteness is undefinable (single formula)
  * there's no sentence ψ such that
  * all M: M ⊨ ψ ⇔ M has infinite domain

=== for reachability ===
"v is reachable via R from u". thinking of R as arrows, it means that there's a path from v to u.

search for formulas χn that express reachability in n steps:

Reachable in n steps:
  1. u = v
  2. R(u,v)
  3. ∃x₁ (RU, x₁) ∧ R(x₁, v))
  4. ∃x₁ ∃x₂ (R(u, x₁) ∧ R(x₁, x₂) ∧ R(x₂, v))
  5. ....

shorthand: χ₂(c,d) denotes formula ∃x₁ (R(c, x₁) ∧ R(x₁, d))

reachability is undefinable:

Let R be a binary relation symbol.
  1. In predicate logic, reachability by R-steps is
    * not definable by a sentence
    * not definable by a set of sentences
  2. In predicate logic, unreachability by R-steps is
    * not definable by a single sentence
    * definable by a set of sentences

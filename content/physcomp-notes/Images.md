# Images
## Image conversion
Image (spatial) sampling

- sampling is done in both space and colour
- brightness is sampled at points and stored in matrix of numbers
- each element is a pixel
- spacial resolution — size in pixels in each direction (e.g. 1920 x 1080, 1280 x 720)

Colour quantisation

- each pixel has a digital value represented in bits
- that’s analog brightness
- with 1 bit, not much is done — binary image
- with 8 bits, greyscale (0-255 per pixel, with white at 255)
- with 24 bits, colour (0-255, 0-255, 0-255 per each pixel in RGB)

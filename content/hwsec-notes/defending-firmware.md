# Defending firmware
Why is it difficult?
Lots of design constraints, so "low-hanging fruit" defenses may be omitted, and there might be unclear error handling strategies (you might not be able to rely on someone restarting the system).
Also, fragmented development process â†’ unclear security guarantees, difficult patching process, reporting nightmare.
Finally, missing entropy sources for randomness, so security things (e.g. crypto) relying on entropy might be bypassable.

Traditional defenses:
- non-executable memory (NX):
  - standard feature in modern MMUs - but embedded systems may not have MMU
  - embedded "solution" is memory protection unit (MPU), with basic memory region protection features
- ASLR
  - implementations assume virtual address space, not possible without MMU
  - firmware often in ROM, so can't randomize for every execution, and compile-time randomization doesn't have same guarantees
  - MMIO & ROM & RAM at fixed addresses
- stack canaries
  - increases code size, stack size, run time -- direct opposition to design
  - typically static values, so simple to bypass

Adoption in practice:
- type-I firmware (based on general-purpose OS) mostly deploy standard defenses
- type-II firmware (based on custom embedded OS) rarely deploy standard defenses
- MMU/MPU not commonly available

Recent defenses:
- static binary sanitization:
  - static instrumentation to detect corruptions to enable fuzzing
  - based on static disassembly & binary rewriting
  - detects: null pointer deref, stack-based buffer overflow, heap buffer overflow, format string, double free
  - significant runtime and size increase
- return address integrity:
  - compiler-based backward-edge CFI
  - protects against overwriting return addresses, implemented on top of LLVM
  - requires MPU and exclusive general purpose register
  - table of return targets stored in RX memory, function ID stored in exclusive register, and ID is generated with call site-specific function key
  - little runtime overhead, but increase in size
- operation execution integrity
  - based on remote attestation
  - detects control-flow hijacking and critical data corruption
  - requires TrustZone for: measurement of control flow transfers and forwarding to verifier, storing copies of protected data
- HERA/hotpatching
  - not all firmware can be updated, patched firmware could have undesired side-effects
  - hotpatching means deploying patches while running
  - HERA -- uses flash patch and breakpoint unit (FPB), lets you divert control flow at specific addresses

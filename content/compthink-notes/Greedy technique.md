# "Greedy" technique
**What is it?**

a simple algorithm, looking for the best (“greedy”) choice from the available alternatives

hoping that series of local optimal choices leads to a global optimal solution to big problem

used to solve optimisation problems

choice on each step should be:

- feasible
- local optimal
- irrevocable

disadvantage: does not operate exhaustively on all data, thus often fails to find globally optimal solution

**Algorithms**

- [Dijkstra's algorithm](./dijkstra-s-algorithm)
- [Prim's algorithm](./prim-s-algorithm)
- [Kruskal's Algorithm](./kruskal-s-algorithm)

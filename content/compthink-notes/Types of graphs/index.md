# Types of graphs
## Symmetricity

| **Undirected (symmetric)** | **Directed/digraph (asymmetric)** | **Mixed** |
| --- | --- | --- |

## Simplicity

| **Simple** | **Multigraph** |
| --- | --- |
| Undirected, unweighted graph that has no loops and no more than one edge between any two different vertices<br>![screenshot.png](aecb0a5cf2b4d7b44991d715d6f8fe77.png) | Multiple edges connecting the same two vertices within a simple graph<br>![screenshot.png](955ccf90835ef4f55efc5af6d3a0cdc1.png) |

## Connectedness

A graph may also have a connected component

| **Connected** | **Disconnected** |
| --- | --- |
| If there is for any two given vertices a path between them<br>![screenshot.png](01e7a5b2f0ddddef838882b31e14bb0c.png) | If not all pairs of vertices have a path between them<br>![screenshot.png](c39fbee31a32652e49b69479cccda233.png) |

# Linear Search (sequential search)
- simplest search algorithm for finding particular element in a list
- efficient for small lists
- belongs to the “Brute force” strategy

How it works:

each element in list is checked one by one based on a condition until desired element is found

element found => location returned, algorithm stops

Performance:

- Best case: 1 comparison
- Worst case: n comparisons
- Average: (n+1)/2 comparisons

Time complexity:

- Worst case n comparisons: O(n)

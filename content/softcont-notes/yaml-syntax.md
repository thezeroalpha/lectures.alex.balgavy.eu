## YAML syntax
Indentation is structure, with spaces (usually 2).
Comments use `#`.

Elements of sequence of scalars (strings, numbers) are a list starting with dash.
Maps are `key: value`.

Long literals can be written with multiple lines that preserve newlines (`|`) or get folded and replaced by space (`>`).

# GDB
- `break` might not work because of anti-debug, set a hardware breakpoint with `hbreak` (but only once program running)
- `starti` sets breakpoint on first instruction and runs
- `bt` prints backtrace of all stack frames
- `frame [n]` can switch you around frames
- `watch` sets a watch point on something and breaks if the value changes
- `next` skips function calls

# Disassembly tools

Tools:
- objdump is often preinstalled
- tools with UI: IDA Pro, Ghidra (free, comes from the NSA)
- Hopper for Mac
- radare2

objdump:
- linear sweep disassembler, assumes everything is code
- no analysis
- assumes headers are correct, likely won't be in malicious binaries
- flags: `-M intel` (intel syntax), `-d` (disassemble executable sections), `-D` (disassemble all sections)

IDA Pro:
- recursive traversal disassembler
- interactive and scriptable, with built-in debugger
- it's expensive if you want the Hex-Rays decompiler
- it's inconvenient to use, based in the DOS days
- there's no undo (in free and older versions)

Ghidra:
- also recursive traversal
- released by NSA in 2019
- open source, free
- has a decompiler, supports undo

## Binary patching
- modify instructions
    - `nop` code to disable it
    - modify data
- you can only replace bytes bu:
    - too small: pad replacement with `nop`s
    - too large: jump elsewhere with more space, jump back later
- to export from ghidra: script manager, need a script for this
- to patch data, go windowâ†’bytes and click the pencil button at the top

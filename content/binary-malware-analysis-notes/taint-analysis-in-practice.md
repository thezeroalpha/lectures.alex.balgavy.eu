# Taint analysis in practice
What to taint:
- data coming from network for attack detection
- program input for analysis

How to propagate taint;
- on move and arithmetic instructions
- clean when you store a constant
- don't propagate on implicit flows and tainted pointers

How to use taint
- for attack detection, check targets of control flow instructions
- for program analysis, monitor syscalls/lib calls/cmp instructions

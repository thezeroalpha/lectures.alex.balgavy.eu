# Parser identification in embedded systems
Data flow graph: graph representing data dependencies between operations
- directed graph
- fire when input data are ready, consume data from input ports and produce data to output ports

Create DFG: transform code to SSA (static single assignment), then draw graph from that. you get a partial ordering of operations.

Solution:
1. Transform binary code to another representation for better reasoning
    - LLVM intermediate language: data flow tracking is possible, SSA form
    - recursive disassembler
    - data flow normalization: model memory as array, replace QEMU load/store with LLVM load/store, detect access to stack and make them SSA
2. Use heuristics to select best candidates for parser functions
    - compute score according to each feature
    - combine (weighted sum) scores to single score, per function
    - heuristics: looped switch statement, data flow analysis on conditional statements, and others
